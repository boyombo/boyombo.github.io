Classes
=======

Classes are another way to organise our code.
There is a concept called "encapsulation" that helps us a lot when programming.
Basically in order to solve complex problems, it is useful to treat parts of the problem like single entities that we know and understand.

Let us consider an example in real life:
Let us say you want to make lunch. You have egusi, water, ugu, meat, stockfish, seasoning, salt, a pot, garri, etc...
An hour later when you are done with cooking, you now have egusi soup (hopefully) and eba. At this point it is sometimes useful to talk in terms of the soup (or meal) as a whole instead of the individual components.
We say the concept of "egusi soup" encapsulates all the ingredients and the things you can do with the soup

# Defining Classes

A class in python is a blueprint for creating `objects`. Like a recipe.
